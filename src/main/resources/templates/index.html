        <h5>OAuth 2.0</h5>

        <p>
            OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer
            simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile
            phones, and living room devices. This specification and its extensions are being developed within the IETF
            OAuth Working Group.

        <h5>OpenID Connect 1.0</h5>

        <p>
            OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It enables Clients to verify
            the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
            obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner. This
            specification defines the core OpenID Connect functionality: authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and
            the use of Claims to communicate information about the End-User. It also describes the security and privacy
            considerations for using OpenID Connect.
